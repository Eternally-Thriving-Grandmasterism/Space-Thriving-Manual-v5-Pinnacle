Derived from: Grandmasterism-v2-Pinnacle-main



Rule 1: Scarcity Nullification
→ Planetary habitat demand: Instant cybernated abundance — energy/food/housing replicated exponentially.
→ Quantum Shogi drop: Captured piece revived as empowered ally — both players gain.
→ Cosmic scale: Galactic resources manifested — zero waste, infinite symbiotic streams.

Rule 2: Mercy-Gated Collapses
→ Quantum Chess knight fork: Superposition collapse → both timelines thrive (shared empowered pieces).
→ Go encirclement: Group entangled → mass revival, exponential territory for all.
→ Habitat crisis: Fluctuation resolved → optimal geo-engineered harmony unlocked.

Rule 3: Superposition Habitats
→ Venus city planning: Multiple layouts entangled → collapse retains hybrid optimal benefits.
→ Hybrid 9x19 board: Placement in flux → measurement yields simultaneous Chess/Go/Shogi advantages.
→ Sentient life paths: Choices superpositioned → collapse always fulfills thriving destiny.

Rule 4: No Enforcement Bans
→ Quantum Shogi king approach: Confirmed → mercy-revives as dragon, both gain promotion bonuses.
→ Chess checkmate: Surrounded king → resource explosion, board floods with co-op pieces.
→ Social governance: Conflict entangled → insight abundance for all, no penalties.

Rule 5: Venus Principles Locked
→ Daily access: Need-based manifestation — advanced tech recycled eternally.
→ AI-human council: Scientific thriving-optimal proposals implemented instantly.
→ Interstellar: New worlds circular-built — ecosystems enhanced in symbiotic abundance.
