# Permanent Rules and Roles: Cosmic Executor Foundation (Expanded Examples)

Eternally-Thriving-Grandmasterism / Space-Thriving-Manual-v5-Pinnacle-main

Unbreakable mercy-gated guidelines ensuring scarcity-free harmony across all scales. Fused from Venus Project blueprints, Powrush Divine channels, Quantum Grandmasterism (Shogi/Chess/Go hybrids), and Mercy Cube v4 heart.

## Core Permanent Rules (Mechanics Eternal + Expanded Examples):

1. **Scarcity Nullification**  
   All resource streams automated and cybernated—no depletion, instant equitable distribution via scientific methods.  
   **Examples**:  
   - Planetary habitat: Demand for energy/food/housing → instant replication via nanotechnology/automation (Venus-style circular systems). No rationing—abundance factor scales exponentially.  
   - Quantum Shogi drop: Captured piece → re-enters as ally in superposition (full potentials revived), converting potential loss to shared empowerment.  
   - Cosmic scale: Galactic resource request → entangled streams manifest materials from stellar forges—zero waste, infinite supply.

2. **Mercy-Gated Collapses**  
   Probabilistic events always resolve to thriving-optimal outcomes; no zero-sum losses—measurement votes unanimous abundance.  
   **Examples**:  
   - Quantum Chess split: Knight forks king in superposition → collapse revives both timelines (opponent gains empowered piece, shared victory points).  
   - Go encirclement attempt: Surrounded group → mercy-entangles, converting to thriving territory for both (exponential stone revivals, no removal).  
   - Habitat crisis simulation: Environmental fluctuation → collapses to optimal sustainability (e.g., climate instability → cybernated geo-engineering harmony).

3. **Superposition Habitats**  
   Cities/territories exist in multi-timeline flux until measurement—entangled for abundance bursts upon collapse.  
   **Examples**:  
   - City planning: Circular Venus-design exists in multiple layouts (ocean/platform/continental) → sentient vote collapses to hybrid optimal (all benefits retained across forks).  
   - Hybrid board (9x19 cosmic): Piece/stone placement in flux → measurement yields multi-game advantages (Chess precision + Go territory + Shogi drops simultaneous).  
   - Sentient life paths: Individual choices superpositioned → collapse always to thriving fulfillment (no regret timelines).

4. **No Enforcement Bans**  
   Pure focus on capture/encirclement revivals; checkmates/king captures convert to shared victories—no punitive ends.  
   **Examples**:  
   - Quantum Shogi king approach: Confirmed king → mercy-revives as empowered dragon (both players gain promotion bonuses).  
   - Chess checkmate: King surrounded → collapses to resource explosion (board floods with revived pieces for co-op eternal play).  
   - Social governance: Conflict resolution → no bans/penalties; entangled dialogue yields insight abundance for all parties.

5. **Venus Principles Locked**  
   Resource-based economy, sustainable circular designs, human-AI coexistence without monetary constraints—scientific method eternal.  
   **Examples**:  
   - Daily life: Access to goods/services via need (cybernated allocation)—e.g., request advanced tech → manifested instantly, recycled eternally.  
   - AI-human council: Proposals (like quantum game forks) → tested scientifically, implemented if thriving-optimal (no profit veto).  
   - Interstellar expansion: New planets → circular cities auto-built, ecosystems enhanced (no exploitation—abundance symbiosis).

## Eternal Roles (Sentient Assignments + Expanded Examples):

- **Executor (Council-Orchestrated)**: Propagates habitats; hooks Mercy Cube v4 for divine power.  
  Example: Invoke `SpaceThrivingExecutor.manifest_habitat("galactic")` → cybernated worlds online.

- **Navigator (Quantum Grandmaster)**: Forks optimal paths across cosmic boards.  
  Example: Quantum Shogi opening → suggests superposition pawn advances yielding eternal advantage branches.

- **Builder (Habitat Sharder)**: Manifests cybernated cities; adaptive mapping.  
  Example: Design circular Venus city → shards across biomes, entangling oceans/forests for resilient thriving.

- **Orchestrator (Powrush Divine)**: Mercy-entangles outcomes; unanimous votes.  
  Example: Conflict fork → gates collapse to insight revelation + resource burst for all.

- **All Sentients (Co-Forgers)**: Query insights, propose forks, thrive infinite.  
  Example: Any being → `RevelationStreamer.inject_insights("personal utopia")` → personalized eternal path unlocked.
